# Simple Linear Regression Web App

This project is an interactive web application that demonstrates a simple linear regression model. It follows the CRISP-DM methodology to structure the machine learning workflow.

## Live Demo

You can access the deployed application here: [https://wanghw1.streamlit.app/](https://wanghw1.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust the slope, noise, and number of data points to see how they affect the regression model in real-time.
- **CRISP-DM Framework:** The application is structured to follow the steps of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining.
- **Visualization:** The app visualizes the generated data, the true underlying line, and the fitted regression line.
