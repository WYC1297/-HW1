# Project Steps: Simple Linear Regression Web App

Based on the requirements in `hw.md`, here is a detailed breakdown of the steps following the CRISP-DM methodology.

## 1. Business Understanding
- **Objective:** Develop an interactive web application to demonstrate and solve a simple linear regression problem.
- **Key Requirements:**
    - The application must follow the CRISP-DM framework.
    - It needs to be more than just code and results; it should include prompts and a clear process.
    - Users must be able to adjust parameters for data generation.
    - The final product should be a deployed web application using Streamlit or Flask.

## 2. Data Understanding
- **Data Source:** The data will be synthetically generated, not from a static dataset.
- **Data Generation Model:** The data will be created based on the linear equation `y = ax + b`.
- **User-configurable Parameters:**
    - `a`: The slope of the line.
    - `noise`: The amount of random noise to introduce into the data points.
    - `Number of points`: The total number of data points to generate.
- **Data Characteristics:** The data will consist of a set of (x, y) coordinates.

## 3. Data Preparation
- **Task:** Create a Python function to generate the dataset.
- **Inputs:** The function will take `a`, `noise`, and `number of points` as arguments.
- **Process:**
    1. Generate a series of `x` values.
    2. Calculate the corresponding `y` values using `y = ax + b` (we can assume a default `b` or let the user set it too).
    3. Add random noise to the `y` values to simulate real-world data.
- **Output:** The function will return two arrays, one for `x` coordinates and one for `y` coordinates.

## 4. Modeling
- **Model Choice:** Simple Linear Regression.
- **Implementation:**
    - Use a Python library like `scikit-learn` to implement the linear regression model.
    - The model will be trained on the synthetically generated data (`x` and `y` values).
- **Objective:** The model will learn the best-fit line for the data and determine the calculated slope and intercept.

## 5. Evaluation
- **Visualization:** The primary method of evaluation will be visual.
- **Plots:**
    1. A scatter plot of the generated data points.
    2. A line plot of the original "true" line (`y = ax + b`).
    3. A line plot of the regression line calculated by the model.
- **Metrics:** Display the coefficients (slope and intercept) of the calculated regression line.

## 6. Deployment
- **Framework:** Choose between Streamlit or Flask. Streamlit is generally faster for data-centric applications like this.
- **User Interface (UI):**
    - Create interactive widgets (e.g., sliders, input boxes) for users to set the values for `a`, `noise`, and `number of points`.
    - A main area to display the plot with the data and lines.
    - A section to show the results, such as the calculated coefficients.
- **Deployment:**
    - Write the application code in a Python script (e.g., `app.py`).
    - Set up the necessary environment and dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
    - Deploy the application to a cloud platform so it's accessible via a URL. The example link points to a Streamlit Cloud app.
